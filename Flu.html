      <p>
        Influenza (flu) can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. It usually comes
        on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Cough</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Sore throat</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Runny or stuffy nose</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Muscle or body aches</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Headaches</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:3px">Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="line-height: 1.4em;">&nbsp;</div>
      <span class="title_text" style="line-height:1.1em"> Flu Treatment </span>
      <ul style="line-height:1.5em">
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px">
          Check with your doctor promptly if you are at high risk of serious flu complications and you get flu symptoms. People at high risk
          of flu complications include young children, adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, and people with certain medical
          conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px">
          Rest up: When you first come down with the flu, rest is what will help give your body the energy it needs to fight the flu virus
          and flu symptoms. This is when you should spend lots of time in bed and on the couch. Stay at home and rest, especially during the
          first 24 hours after becoming ill (unless medical attention is necessary).
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px">
          Stay hydrated: Drinking lots of liquids like water, sports drinks or electrolyte beverages will help prevent dehydration and treat
          the flu. And don’t forget tea and broth—hot liquids help relieve nasal congestion and soothe the uncomfortably inflamed membranes
          that line your nose and throat.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px">
          Take some medicine: If you’ve got a fever, cough or other flu symptoms, over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, like NyQuil and
          DayQuil can help ease flu symptoms in adults.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:5px">
          See your doctor: It’s important to note that if you become very sick with the flu or are at a high risk of developing
          complications from the flu, you should call your doctor. He or she may put you on antiviral drugs within the 48 hours of your
          symptoms, which can lessen the severity and duration of flu symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>
